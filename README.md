# Classification-Tools
Multiple useful tools to learn the classification models in data science
This is a tool that can use the pycaret to train the dataset with different models in one block, and then create comparison with the same test set. 
By using this tool, we can get the information of which model has the best performance among all the models and which runs the fastest in the same environment.
